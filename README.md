# Sine Mess

http://un.khz.fi/sine-mess/

Sine Mess (should have named it ASDF) was my entry to the SC5 Code Challenge 2014.

## Rules of participation

    Level 1: make a line of text animate through the screen from right to left
    Level 2: make Individual words or letters follow a sine wave
    Level 3: spice it up! Make it pop!

  * Sass / Less / Stylus are OK and preferred. If you use one of them, include the source file in your submission.
  * SVG is OK too
  * NO JavaScript or canvas animations. Those might be covered on later rounds.
  * Your entry will be run on Chrome version 39. The machine is a standard 2013 MBP (OS X 10.9.4)
  * NB: the rules first talked about using "the newest Chrome Canary version" which at the time was version 39 but recently changed to 40. However, it seems version 40 introduced some CSS bugs and we'll use version 39 unless you absolutely want to use version 40.
  * Assume a 1024x768 viewport. Smaller is OK too. (The specific resolution might change depending on streaming requirements.)
  * Your final submission should be sent before 2014–10–09 00:00:00. Updating your code before that is OK.

## Personal rules

  * Timebox to last evening before deadline
  * Learn something new
  * Fight against perfectionism

## Ingredients

Gulp is used to build 2 SCSS files into index.css. Otherwise it uses plain HTML with no JavaScript.
